## 🏗️ System Architecture & Logic Flow

To navigate our monorepo efficiently, understand how data flows between the three core services:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Client_Side [Frontend]
        A[Next.js App]
    end

    subgraph Logic_Layer [Backends]
        B[Node.js / Express]
        C[FastAPI / AI]
    end

    subgraph Data_Layer [Persistence]
        D[(MongoDB)]
        E[(Pinecone Vector DB)]
        F[(Redis Cache)]
    end

    A <-->|Auth / CRUD| B
    A <-->|RAG Chat / Roadmap| C
    B <-->|Prisma| D
    B --- F
    C <-->|Embeddings| E
    C ---|Metadata| D
```

## 🛠️ Contribution Roadmap (Find Your Fit)

New to the project? Use this table to find issues that match your specific skills and interest areas. This helps you skip the "Configuration Fatigue" and jump straight into coding.

| Category | Tech Stack | Quick Start Tasks |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🎨 Frontend** | React 19, Tailwind 4 | UI/UX improvements, Framer Motion animations, Responsive fixes |
| **⚙️ Backend** | Express, Prisma, Redis | API optimization, Webhook integrations, Database indexing |
| **🧠 AI/Data** | Python, FastAPI, RAG | Prompt tuning, LangChain flow improvements, Vector DB logic |
| **📝 Docs/DevOps** | Markdown, Docker | Improving setup scripts, writing test cases, Mermaid.js diagrams |

## 🚀 Quick Start (Anti-Fatigue Setup)

Edulume is a large monorepo. To avoid "Configuration Fatigue," we recommend starting with a **Lite Setup** unless you are specifically working on AI features.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v20.12.2+
- Python 3.11+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Git

### 🧩 The "Mock Mode" Strategy
Don't have all 10+ API keys (Groq, Pinecone, OpenAI, etc.)? **You can still contribute!**
* **Lite Setup:** Fill only the `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET` in your `.env` file.
* **Impact:** Core features like the **Discussion Forum**, **Resource Uploads**, and **User Profiles** will work perfectly without any AI keys.
* **AI Tasks:** You only need the full API suite if you are specifically testing the RAG Chatbot, PDF interactions, or Roadmap generator.

### Installation
Follow these steps to get the environment running in under 10 minutes:
# 1. Clone & Root setup
```
git clone [https://github.com/tarinagarwal/edulume.git](https://github.com/tarinagarwal/edulume.git)
cd edulume
```

# 2. Frontend (Terminal 1)
```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

# 3. Backend (Terminal 2)
```
cd server
npm install
npm run db:generate
npm run dev
```

# 4. AI Backend (Terminal 3) - Optional for non-AI tasks
```
cd python-backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## 📊 Database Schema
We use **Prisma** with **MongoDB** to maintain structured relationships and ensure data integrity. Understanding these models is essential for any backend-related contributions.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ DISCUSSION : "writes"
    USER ||--o{ ENROLLMENT : "enrolled_in"
    DISCUSSION ||--o{ ANSWER : "has"
    COURSE ||--o{ CHAPTER : "contains"
    COURSE ||--o{ ENROLLMENT : "tracks"
    PDF ||--o{ USER : "uploaded_by"
    USER ||--o{ NOTIFICATION : "receives"
```

### 📊 Database Models

| Model                        | Description                 |
